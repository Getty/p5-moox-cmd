## Name

    MooX::Cmd - Giving an easy Moo style way to make command organized CLI apps

## Description

    Eases the writing of command line utilities, accepting commands and
    subcommands and so on. These commands can form a tree, which is
    mirrored in the package structure. On invocation each command along
    the path through the tree (starting from the toplevel command
    through to the most specific one) is instanciated.
